# Skills
- JavaScript - Intermidiate
- C++ - Advanced
- Bash - Beginner
  ### Level explanation (In this context)
  Beginner in this context means: I can program with it to create some programs but doesn't experienced for a long time or just start learning on it.
  Advanced in this context means: I'm experienced in this language for more than 3 months now. And I could use it for creating programs.
  Intermidiate in this context means: I'm experienced in this language for almost a year. And I use it for creating many hobby projects more than 10 projects.

# History
In 2021 I was a man who used to play games as a hobby, but until I tried to creating a mods for some games I play it for a long time. And I was interest in it. I spent an 8 hours a day for every weekend working on mods for almost 2 months at that moment I was very fun to do it and I was thinking that if I could use it for being an another hobby. So I started buying a books for programming the first programming language I hardly learned on it is C. I read it so much on it. then I tried another programming language because I like to jump to another programming language frequently, I jumped to C++ and I interested in it. So, I learned it for a long time and I tried to create a project with it (I created it locally but I deleted it already). Then, I moved to JavaScript to try web development and I was so interested on it because of I love it syntaxs so I spent a year with JavaScript until I jumped back to C++ (Now) because I jump programming language frequently as I telled in above. I jump programming language so frequently and that's make me learn on many skills but in the same time that provide a bad habits to me that I don't study on something for a long time.
